# twitter-search

Nodejs twitter search tool.
Built to be used with the Twitter API v2 to [search tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/introduction).

Your app needs the "Academic Research access" for searching the full archive.

This code is licensed under The Unlicense which means you can do whatever you want to do with it, no obligations. I would prefer you do something unharmful though :)
